/**
 * Interface for an object which handles a set of view
 * and controller linkages to form a view 'flow'.
 * <p/>
 * As the user takes actions in views, named resolutions
 * are fired, and this object decides where to go next
 * based on those resolution names, and potentially also
 * on the state of the model at that time.
 * <p/>
 * In principle, this is very similar to the basic concepts
 * of struts or other web MVC implementations.  However, there
 * seemed to be no similar implementation for OO view frameworks
 * such as Swing, Echo, Millstone etc.  This is a simple
 * implementation to fill that gap.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Note -</b>The API is designed in a stateless paradigm, but flows
 * are not stateless, so this will probably be re-factored, to remove the need
 * to hold a reference to the previous flow outcome in order to ask for the
 * next one.
